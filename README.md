## About this boilerplate

* It's an easy to use api boilerplate. User authentication is done with Sanctum. It contains all the basic authentication features like signup, signin and logout.
* It contains a crudable trait that you can use in your controller which covers all the basic crud operations. See the usage of this trait in App\Http\Controllers\UserController.php
* I implemented the repository design patterm in that project.
